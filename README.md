# PNPT Study Notes & Homelab

This repo contains my personal notes and lab work while preparing for the [PNPT certification](https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/pnpt/) by TCM Security.

The goal is to document what I learn along the way from basic networking to Active Directory attacks and to organize everything in one place for review and future reference.

## Structure (So Far)

- `Network Refresher/` – core networking concepts (IP, MAC, OSI, TCP/UDP, etc.)
- `Information Gathering/` – passive recon, email discovery
- `Ethical Hacker Methodology/` – basic overview of the five hacking stages
- `.obsidian/` – Obsidian vault config (graph, plugins, workspace layout)

## Tools & Topics (So Far)

- Subnetting, ports, protocols
- OSINT basics
- Internal linking via Obsidian

## Notes

This is a work in progress. Some sections will be expanded over time as I go deeper into the PNPT course content and build more attack simulations in my homelab.
